Q3
My considerations were how to define popularity and what the unit of measurement of time should be.
Popularity definitions: most number of people buying? highest quantity sales? highest price sales?
Both number of people buying and number of items to be purchased has similar distributions over time. Hence it is more intuitive to look into number of people buying
Popularity: Most number of people buying => staff allocation
unit of measure: staff allocation => shift by hours

Conclusion: The most popular (number of people making transactions) timing of the day is from 6pm - 7pm.
